A simple flutter plugin that downloads all files types to downloads directory in all android devices.
When android 10 came out, privacy restrictions were changed in big way
and there are not enough flutter-related info about it,
so I came up with a simple ANDROID plugin to downloads any file type to downloads directory
Also it has callbacks and progress listeners with a very easy installation
<br>
Note: This plugin is not built for iOS, it will not effect it at all.

## Features:

- Ability to change file name once downloaded
- Ability to create sub directories to download your file(s) in
- Ability to download files over POST request
- Ability to write base64 content into a local file
- Ability to start a bulk download
- Ability to pass headers with each download task
- Ability to manage download notifications (all/progress only/off)
- Ability to determine where to download (public downloads/app directory)
- Ability to track download progress

## Getting Started

First, make sure that you've added the permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

Add the following line to your pubspec.yaml  
``` flutter_file_downloader: ^2.0.0```

Next,  
    add the library import to your dart file,  
```
import 'package:flutter_file_downloader/flutter_file_downloader.dart';
```

Last step,  
    use the library easily in your code  
```
//You can download a single file
FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: "YOUR DOWNLOAD URL",
    name: "THE FILE NAME AFTER DOWNLOADING",//(optional) 
    subPath: "your/desired/sub/path",//(optional) 
    onProgress: (String fileName, double progress) {
      print('FILE fileName HAS PROGRESS $progress');
    },
    onDownloadCompleted: (String path) {
      print('FILE DOWNLOADED TO PATH: $path');
    },
    onDownloadError: (String error) {
      print('DOWNLOAD ERROR: $error');
    });
    
//Or download multiple files 
final List<File?> result = await FileDownloader.downloadFiles(
    urls: [
        'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vChK6pTy3vN3KbYZ7UU7k3-320-80.jpg',
        'https://fansided.com/files/2015/10/cat.jpg',
    ],
    isParallel: true,   //if this is set to true, your download list will request to be downloaded all at once
                        //if your downloading queue fits them all, they all will start downloading
                        //if it's set to false, it will download every file individually
                        //default is true
    onAllDownloaded: () {
      //This callback will be fired when all files are downloaded
    });
    //This method will return a list of File? in the same order as the urls,
    //so if the url[2] failed to download, 
    //then result[2] will be null
    
//You can enable or disable the log, this will help you track your download batches
FileDownloader.setLogEnabled(true);
//default is false

//You can set the number of consecutive downloads to help you preserving device's resources 
FileDownloader.setMaximumParallelDownloads(10);
    //This method will allow the plugin to download 10 files at a time
    //if you requested to download more than that, it will wait until a download is done to start another
    //default is 25, maximum is 25, minimum is 1
```

Also, you can change the download destination by passing downloadDestination,
this can by one of the enum's values:
- `DownloadDestinations.publicDownloads //(DEFAULT)` 
- `DownloadDestinations.appFiles`
## Example:
```
FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: url.text.trim(),
    name: name.text.trim(),
    downloadDestination: DownloadDestinations.appFiles,
);
```

And you can change download notifications to be:
- all enabled: progress, success & failed notifications will be delivered to the user
- all disabled: no notifications will be displayed to the user, this option require you to add a permission in the manifest `android.permission.DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION`
- or the default, only progress notifications will appear to the user
this can by one of the enum's values:
- `NotificationType.all`
- `NotificationType.progressOnly //(DEFAULT)`
- `NotificationType.disabled`
## Example:
```
FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: url.text.trim(),
    name: name.text.trim(),
    notificationType: NotificationType.all,
);
```

### v1.2.0+ changes:
**You can now pass headers to your download request**
```
var downloadUrls = [
    'https://fansided.com/files/2015/10/cat.jpg',
    'https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b9/17/64/b91764a4a240c340bdd0f3ba452f384a.jpg',
    'https://www.banningvet.com/files/banning_vet/puppies-kittens.jpg',
    'https://tinypng.com/images/social/developer-api.jpg',
];

/// using a single download request
final File? = await FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: downloadUrls[0],
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic ...'}
);

/// using bulck download, this will send the same headers for every download link in the array
final List<File?> files = await FileDownloader.downloadFiles(
    urls: downloadUrls,
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic ...'}
);

/// using bulck download, this will send a different headers for every download link in the array
final List<File?> files = await FileDownloader.downloadFilesWithCustomHeaders(requests: [
    DownloadFileRequest(downloadUrls[0], headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic token1'}),
    DownloadFileRequest(downloadUrls[1], headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic token2'}),
    DownloadFileRequest(downloadUrls[2], headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic token3'}),
    DownloadFileRequest(downloadUrls[3], headers: {'Authorization': 'Basic token4'}),
])
```
**Also you can cancel a processing download**
```
//by first getting the download id as follows:
FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: url.text.trim(),
    onDownloadRequestIdReceived: (id) {
        setState(() => _downloadId = id);
    },
);

//and then call the cancelDownload function which returns a bool
final canceled = await FileDownloader.cancelDownload(_downloadId!);
print('Canceled: $canceled');
```
<br></br>

## Examples:
**All callbacks are nullables, you can simply call** `FileDownloader.downloadFile(url: YOUR_URL);`
```
FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: "https://tinypng.com/images/social/website.jpg",
    name: "PANDA",
    onDownloadCompleted: (path) {
        final File file = File(path);
        //This will be the path of the downloaded file
    });
```
```
final List<File?> result = await FileDownloader.downloadFiles(
    urls: [
        'https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vChK6pTy3vN3KbYZ7UU7k3-320-80.jpg',
        'https://fansided.com/files/2015/10/cat.jpg',
    ],
    isParallel: false);
    
print('FILES: ${result.map((e) => e?.path).join(',\n')}');
```
```
final File? file = await FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: "https://tinypng.com/images/social/developer-api.jpg",
    name: "ANOTHER PANDA.jpg");

print('FILE: ${file?.path}');
```

You can also track the progress if you want to add a progress bar
```
final File? file = await FileDownloader.downloadFile(
    url: "https://tinypng.com/images/social/developer-api.jpg",
    name: "ANOTHER PANDA.jpg",
    onProgress: (String? fileName, double progress) {
        setState(() => _progress = progress);
    });

print('FILE: ${file?.path}');`
```
